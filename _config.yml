  #         I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

        #     This paper proposes a 3D-stacked memory system that combines a Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) and High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) to improve the performance of memory-intensive applications. The proposed system is designed to exploit the advantages of both HMC and HBM, which have different characteristics in terms of bandwidth, latency, and energy consumption. The proposed system is evaluated using a cycle-accurate simulator, and the results show that the proposed system can improve the performance of memory-intensive applications by up to 1.5x compared to a system that uses only HMC or HBM.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
